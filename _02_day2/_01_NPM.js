// npm ----------node package manager----

/*

node package manager is the default package manager for the javascript runtime environment node.js.

What is package.json  ?

whatever packages you have installed from npm all the details are stored in package.json in the form of dependencies.

all the extra information about the packages are stored inside package-lock.json

then you also need to require the module

eg in command

npm init chalk

then 

const chalk = require('chalk');


note -> validator is a npde package which can be used for form validation.
note -> in the JSON file both the property and its values are written inside the double quotes.
