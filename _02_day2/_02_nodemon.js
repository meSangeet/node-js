//------------- Nodemon -----------------//

/*
As we studied about the packages in the previous modules. They were added in the dependencies. There can be global packages 
which we don't need to add specially in every project. They will be added globally.

by using nodemon you can change the code ad you don't need to rerun the program. The program will be auto run.

ctrl + c for exit.
