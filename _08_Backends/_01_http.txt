HTTP

It is a protocil that is defined for machines to communicate.
Specifically for the websites it is most common way for your website's
frontend to talk to its backend.
Some code that follows the HTTP protocol is able to communicate with 
clients(browsers/mobile apps etc).

In the end its the client throwing some information at a server. Server 
doing something the client sends, server responding back with the 
final result.

Things clients need to worry about to send a request to server

1. Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
2. Address (URL/IP/PORT)
3. Routes
4. Headers, Body, Query Params
5. Method

Things server needs wo worry about while responding back

1. Response Headers
2. Response Body
3. Status Codes

Generally this is how a communication would look like

Client Side 

1. https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/conversation

    https -> protocol 
    chat.openai.com -> url 
    last part -> route 

2. Header / Authorization Header 

    Cookie -> to let the server know that who is logged in 

3. Method 

    GET/POST etc -> to decide the method how to send this information 


Server Side 

server sends back 
1. response Body
2. response header 
3. status code 

Things that happen in your browser after you fire this request 

1. Browser parses the URL 
2. Does a DNS lookup (converts url to IP)
3. Establishes a connection to the IP (does handshake)

What is DNS resolution ? 

URLs are just like contact in your phone. In the end, they map to an IP
If you ever buy a URL of your own, you will need to point it to the IP
of your server.
